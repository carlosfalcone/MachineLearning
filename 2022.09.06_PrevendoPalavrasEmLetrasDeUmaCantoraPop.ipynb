rose to claim it it was dark and i was over until you kissed my lips and you saved me my hands they were strong but my knees were far too weak to stand in your arms without falling to your feet but theres a side to you that i never knew never knew all the things youd say they were never true never true and the games youd play you would always win always win but i set fire to the rain watched it pour as i touched your face well it burned while i cried cause i heard it screaming out your name your name when i lay with you i could stay there close my eyes feel you here forever you and me together nothing is better cause theres a side to you that i never knew never knew all the things youd say they were never true never true and the games youd play you would always win always win but i set fire to the rain watched it pour as i touched your face well it burned while i cried cause i heard it screaming out your name your name i set fire to the rain and i threw us into the flames when it fell something died cause i knew that that was the last time the last time sometimes i wake up by the door that heart you caught must be waiting for you even now when were already over i cant help myself from looking for you i set fire to the rain watched it pour as i touched your face well it burned while i cried cause i heard it screaming out your name your name i set fire to the rain and i threw us into the flames when it fell something died cause i knew that that was the last time the last time oh some say ill be better without you but they dont know you like i do or at least the sides i thought i knew i cant bear this time it drags on as i lose my mind reminded by things i find like notes and clothes youve left behind wake me up wake me up when all is done i wont rise until this
